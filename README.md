# week 01 
created helloworld.py and pushed to GitHub

# week 02 
bank.py

The program should:

1.Prompt the user and read in two money amounts (in cent)
2.Add the two amounts
3.Print out the answer in a human readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount 

```
$ python bank.py
Enter amount1(in cent): 65
Enter amount2(in cent): 180
The sum of these is â‚¬2.45
```

# week 03 
accounts.py

Weekly Task 03
Bank account numbers can stored as 10 character strings, for security reasons some applications only display the last 4 characters (with the other other characters replaced with Xs).

Write a python program called accounts.py that reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs).
```
$ python accounts.py
Please enter an 10 digit account number: 1234567890
XXXXXX7890
```

# week 03  EXTRA task 
extraaccounts.py

TASK: Modify the program to deal with account numbers of any length (yes that is a vague requirement, comment your assumptions)

My assumption is that in some banks can exist bank accounts numbers with more than 10 digits (i.e. IBAN = 22 digits or 34 digits)
In any way we want to show only the last 4 characters. 

I used len() and replace() because I`ve used them in DataCamp https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science/chapter-3-functions-and-packages/


# week 04
collatz.py
Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.
At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.
Have the program end if the current value is one.

it`s the first idea - should change print outs, so it will be one row not a column


# week 05
weekday.py

Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday. 

An example of running this program on a Thursday is given below.
```
$ python weekday.py
Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday.
```

An example of running it on a Saturday is as follows:
```
$ python weekday.py
It is the weekend, yay!
```
